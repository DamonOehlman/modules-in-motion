## Who am I?

- Application developer.
- Working with JS longer than I'll probably admit.  Last ~7 years have been pretty much full time JS.
- Generally interested in new and emerging tech. Worked with WebRTC for a couple of years.
- Currently working at Canva.

## WARNING: Presentation may contain personal bias

- I still ðŸ’– browserify (and thus CommonJS).
- I never converted to WebPack (though I can see the appeal).
- Transpilation is not my favourite thing (but I do like types so that's one area I think it's potentially worthwhile).

## Talk overview

1. Brief history of approaches to modularity in JS
2. A walk through of ES6 modules (with CommonJS equivalents). Info on some gotchas.
3. A look into the future.

## Key Objectives for Modules

1. Implement functionality within a contained space.
2. To export appropriate parts of that functionality so that it can be consumed readily.
   - Extra points for interoperability.
3. To provide well tested and quality code that consumers can trust.

## Why do I care?

1. I build modules (e.g. rtc.io)
2. I like to use other peoples modules (when they look solid)
3. I like applications I build to have sane structure
