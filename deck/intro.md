## May contain trace amounts of bias

- I still ðŸ’– [`browserify`](https://github.com/substack/node-browserify)
- I (personally) never converted to [`webpack`](https://webpack.js.org)
- Transpilation is __not__ my favourite thing
- I like typed JS (actually types in general)

## Talk overview

1. Brief history of approaches to modularity in JS
2. Walk through of ES6 modules (with CommonJS equivalents)
3. A little detour into the land of tree shaking
4. A look into the future

## Key Objectives for Modules

1. Implement functionality within a contained space.
2. To export appropriate parts of that functionality so that it can be consumed readily.
   - Extra points for interoperability.
3. To provide well tested and quality code that consumers can trust.

## Why do I care?

1. I build modules (e.g. [`rtc.io`](github.com/rtc-io))
2. I like to use other peoples modules (when they look solid)
3. I like applications I build to have sane structure
