# Modules in motion

This is a repository for the presentation "Modules in motion".

The most interesting parts of the module is the generated output which can be viewed at:

http://damonoehlman.github.io/modules-in-motion/

And; the experiments directory that can be found within this repo.  This is a series of experiments that I worked through to validate the data shared in various web posts and also to clarify some of my concerns about various implementations of things like tree shaking, etc.

Additionally, a companion repo of this talk is probably of interested to you too:
